											<h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Ever since I was young, I have been interested in tinkering with code and assembling and disassembling computers. At first, I learned about C++ by reading books about it and trying make some simple hello world programs. Then, I got into Roblox, and made games on that platform using Lua and the Roblox Studio Engine from ages becoming a teenager. Also during that time, I started helping out my Middle School's tech team with computer issues, which gave me hands-on experience with hardware. At age 14, I was able to save up enough money to build my first gaming pc, which only fueled my desire for computers. Also between that time, I used CodeAcademy to learn HTML5, and Scratch to experiment with logic. I then focused on graduating high school which decreased my programming time, with the exception of a few certificates from Code.org. Recently, my coding skills have grown exponentially. I have been programming in C++ for 1 year officially, and in Java for 6 months. I also have spent a lot of time using SageMath, GlowScript (VPython), and MatLab/Simulink for 6 months. I also completed an accelerated Web Development course over Janurary, and gained experience in HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript. I have experimented with Python, React, and JavaScript as well in the JPMorgan Software Engineering Experience. I love to learn and build, as it has been a part of my life since the beginning. </p>
