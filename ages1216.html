											<h2>Summary</h2>
										</header>
										<p>This section of my portfolio is meant to showcase many of the programming/game projects I did when I was new to programming overall. When I discovered I could build games on Roblox, I started experimenting with their game engine and building random games. During this time, I also started experimenting with Unity and iOS game development. Though I never created a full game for iOS, I have a few prototypes. Keep in mind that all of these games were created without any formal training or knowledge, and as such will be slightly messy.
										If you attempt to play any of the Roblox games, keep in mind that I have not updated any of them in years with a few exceptions to touch up on a few bugs, and as such the game logic might be broken in some areas due to Roblox updates. </p>
										<p>Skills Learned/Utilized: Lua, Roblox Studio, Independent Learning, C#, Unity </p>

														<h3>Tech Team App</h3>
													</header>
													<p>The last of my iOS development attempts, was an app for my High School Tech Team. This app was planned to allow the team to message eachother privately and publically. It was also going to have a "Tips and Tricks" section, in which known and newly learned tips and tricks for problems faced could be published. Lastly, it was going to have an "Announcements" section, where the Lead Tech Specialist could send messages to the entire team. However, this app was unable to be completed due to hardware and internet issues, as I struggled to figure out how Google Firebase worked, and was eventually told to drop the project in early 2018. As a result of programming this on a school computer and losing access to the email used to store the backup, I no longer have the files.</p>

														<h3>Flappy Trump</h3>
													</header>
													<p>As the title states, this was a Flappy Bird clone, but Trump themed. One of my first attempts at creating an iOS app so I could experiment with creating more games in hopes of becoming an iOS developer, and I successfully created a protoype with the help of a tutorial on Flappy Bird, but I did not end up getting to finish this app as I was unable to compile it due to hardware reasons. As such, I had to stop developing it. </p>

														<h3>Ads: The Video Game</h3>
													</header>
													<p>This game was supposed to be a "clicker" game, but with a twist. The user would be awarded points when an ad was closed, and advertisements would continue to pile onto their screen as they played. Did not get very far with this one, as I quickly realized it was a silly idea. Scrapped in late 2016.</p>
