											<h2>A Summary about Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="color:black">Ever since I was young, I have been interested in tinkering with code and assembling and disassembling computers. At first, I learned about C++ by reading books about it and trying make some simple hello world programs. Then, I got into Roblox, and made games on that platform using Lua and the Roblox Studio Engine from ages becoming a teenager. Also during that time, I started helping out my Middle School's tech team with computer issues, which gave me hands-on experience with hardware. At age 14, I was able to save up enough money to build my first gaming pc, which only fueled my desire for computers. Also between that time, I used CodeAcademy to learn HTML5, and Scratch to experiment with logic. I then focused on graduating high school which decreased my programming time, with the exception of a few certificates from Code.org. Recently, my coding skills have grown exponentially. I have been programming in C++ for 1 year officially, and in Java for 6 months. I also have spent a lot of time using SageMath, GlowScript (VPython), and MatLab/Simulink for 6 months. I also completed an accelerated Web Development course over Janurary, and gained experience in HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript. I have experimented with Python, React, and JavaScript as well in the JPMorgan Software Engineering Experience. I love to learn and build, as it has been a part of my life since the beginning. I recently attended the JPMorgan Chase Data for Good Hackathon! There, we were tasked with analyzing data to find countries for US importers to import agricultural products from in order to maximize social good while minimizing environmental costs. I found it super fun! </p>
